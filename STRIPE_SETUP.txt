
STRIPE SETUP
================================================================================================================================

If you also want to activate the Stripe payment gateway, you need to follow the steps below:


1. You will want to specify in Stripe that it should validate the billing postal code, which is highly recommended to prevent fraudulent 
   charges. You can enable this setting in your Stripe account settings here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/account. Just check the box 
   that says "Charges that fail zip code verification".


2. In your Stripe account, create your plans. This can be done at https://dashboard.stripe.com/plans. These plans will coincide with your 
   MONTHLY subscription packages you create in the admin panel. Plans are NOT needed for your add-on credit packages as they are only required 
   for subscription(recurring) payments.

   So if you create 5 monthly subscription credit packages in the script, you will need to create 5 plans in your Stripe account. 
   Just match up the ID, name, and amount fields.


3. If you create MONTHLY subscription packages in the admin, then you need to set a notification URL in Stripe. 
   In Stripe, go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks

   * Click on the "Add endpoint" button and enter "http://YOURSITEURL/users/getnotification" -- where YOURSITEURL is the exact location of where 
     you have the script installed at.

   * Select "Live" as the mode.

   * Click the "Select Events" radio button and check the boxes for these 5 events:
     
     1.customer.subscription.created
     2.customer.subscription.deleted
     3.customer.subscription.updated
     4.invoice.payment_succeeded
     5.invoice.payment_failed

   * Click the Create endpoint button.


4. Whilst logged into your scripts administrative panel, click on 'Config', then click on 'Stripe Config', and 'Edit'. 
   
   * Enter your Stripe Live Secret Key and Live Publishable Key
     (You API keys can be obtained by going to account settings at https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/apikeys)

   * Save changes


IMPORTANT: Stripe requires SSL be installed on your domain. Using Stripe, sensitive credit card information is sent directly 
to Stripe, and does NOT touch your server. However, in order to protect yourself from certain forms of man-in-the-middle attacks, 
you must serve the page containing the payment form over HTTPS as well. 

Additionally, your customers are more comfortable sharing sensitive information on pages visibly served over HTTPS, which can help 
increase your customer conversion rate.

FORCE SSL Redirection
====================================================================================================================================

Once you have SSL installed on your server and you can access your site through https://, you may want to force the site to always
use https:// and not http://. 

1. Open your .htaccess file in the root folder of your install.
2. Uncomment(remove the # sign) next to "RewriteCond %{ENV:HTTPS} !on [NC]"
3. If script is installed in a sub-folder(example: http://yourdomain.com/script), uncomment(remove the # sign) next to 
   
   "RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{SERVER_NAME}/$1 [R,L]"

4. If script is installed in the main domain or a sub-domain, uncomment(remove the # sign) next to 

   "RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{SERVER_NAME} [R,L]"

5. Save changes
